# ⚙️ Flow-Temperature-Control-of-Granular-Materials

## 📘 This project focuses on the automatic regulation of both the flow rate and temperature of a granular material using dynamic control loops. It includes:

    🔁 Modeling and identification of control loops for flow and thermal systems

    🧠 Controller design using classical (PID, PI, PD) and advanced methods (predictive, frequency-based, quasi-optimal)

    🔄 Cascade control structures for improved performance

    📊 Performance analysis through step and ramp responses

    🧪 Detailed simulations and comparative evaluation of multiple control strategies

## 🛠️ Tools: Control theory, dynamic system modeling, MATLAB/Simulink (assumed), and advanced tuning techniques.

## ✅ The goal: Achieve precise, responsive, and robust control across varying operational conditions.
